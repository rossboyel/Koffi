As someone who enjoys buying fresh coffee each week, I go through a lot of coffee. 
That means that I am constantly changing my grinde size, dosage and extraction times to suit the style of coffee that I am brewing.

This project is for my own use and will allow me to remember which coffee I have bought in the past, the extractions I have had with the 
coffee and most importantly - which settings gave me the best results for the next time I brew the coffee.
